# - Reject entries that are not in moves; ask again without using a round.
# - Convert uppercase input to lowercase and strip outer spaces.
# - Let the player enter q to quit.
# - Count wins, draws, and losses across the five rounds.
# - Simulate 600 rounds using random choices for both players.
#   Print the totals and calculate wins / 600 * 100 as the win percentage.
