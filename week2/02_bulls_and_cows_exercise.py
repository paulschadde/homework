# Optional extensions:
# - Reject guesses whose length is not four.
# - Accept only digits 0-9.
# - Reject repeated digits.
#   Check these before the for loop; use continue to ask again if invalid.
# - Let the player enter q to quit.
# - Count guesses or set an attempt limit.
# - Generate a random secret with four different digits.
